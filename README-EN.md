About
My AutoHotKey library came up with some scripts to simplify the operation.

## Switch virtual desktop (Win)
Due to the lack of a recording Win shortcut key in the Razer mouse driver, I wrote AHK to operate Ctrl + Win + Left or Right to switch between virtual desktops, making it easier to organize and categorize work desktops.
Operation guide:

Switch left and right by operating `the side button of the mouse`.
